        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Idli is a steamed breakfast dish which is made with the combination of
          rava (semolina) and yogurt. Idlis are soft, fluffy, and spongy in
          texture, owing to the fermentation process of the batter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a traditional South Indian dish that has gained popularity
          worldwide for its simplicity, health benefits, and delicious taste.
          Idlis are typically served hot with accompaniments such as sambar (a
          lentil-based vegetable stew), coconut chutney, or various types of
          spicy chutneys.
